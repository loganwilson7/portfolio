<line num="1">Shall I compare thee to a <compare> <!-- Shakespeare comparing fair youth to a summer's day -->> summer’s day</compare>?</line>
<line num="2">Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</line>
<line num="3">Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</line>
<line num="4">And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;</line>
<line num="5">Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</line>
<line num="6">And often is <irony><!-- man is supposed to "outlive" summer day. What could complexion "dimming" imply? -->his gold complexion dimm'd</irony>;</line>
<line num="7">And every fair from fair sometime declines,</line>
<line num="8">By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;</line>
<line num="9">But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</line>
<line num="9">Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;</line>

<line num="13">So <message><!-- "long lives this" is referencing as long as there are beautiful summer days -->long lives this</message>, and this gives life to thee.</line></root>
